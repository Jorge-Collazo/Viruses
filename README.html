    <p>A virus is a malicious software, code, or program that is created to altar the way a computer works. They are also meant to spread from one computer to another. They act like real life viruses since both need a “host”. Computer viruses need a file or document. They attach themselves to legitimate programs or documents and later start to carry out their purpose.</p>
    
    <h3>Whats causes them?</h3>
    <p>Viruses are created by people that are always trying to infect others computers. Viruses can be spread in a number of ways, such as email attachments, downloaded files, or visits to unsecured websites.</p>

    <h3>How to prevent them.</h3>
    <p>To prevent viruses, people should not click on or download any links or download anything sent to them by suspicious accounts. Hard drives found in public places may contain a virus and should not be used.</p>

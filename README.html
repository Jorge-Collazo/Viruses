    <h1>Viruses</h1>

    <h3>What are they?</h3>
    <p>A virus is a malicious software, code, or program that is created to altar the way a computer works. They are also meant to spread from one computer to another. They act like real life viruses since both need a “host”. Computer viruses need a file or document. They attach themselves to legitimate programs or documents and later start to carry out their purpose.</p>
